# Linear-Regression
In this linear regression, the aim was to build a regression model to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This focused on identifying key predictors and assessing their impact on the target variable. The result of the model provided insights into how the predictors influenced the target variable, and the model's performance was evaluated based on key metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

following models were used:

Elastic Net Model: The best parameters found were alpha = 100 and l1_ratio = 1 through a grid search. This model helps combine the penalties of both Lasso and Ridge regression models.

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 14,195.35
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 20,558.51

These results indicate the prediction errors of the model on the test data, with lower values representing better model performance.
